\title{Define a Hidden Markov Model}
\usage{
hmm(transition, emission, n_timesteps, dim = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{transition}{a K x K matrix of transition probabilities between hidden
states}

\item{emission}{a K x N matrix of emission probabilities between hidden and
observed states}

\item{n_timesteps}{the number of timesteps (length of the observed state
matrix) - must be a positive scalar integer}
}
\description{
Define a Hidden Markov Model as a probability distribution over
a sequence of states
